    <p> After working as a Landscape Desginer for almost 10 years I decided to take the plunge and start a new career in Full Stack Development. I've always been interested in website design and I've always had a passion to be creative and build things so this would be a perfect fit for me, so last January I started the journey of becoming a Full Stack Developer. I started out with some online courses such as Udemy and Free Code Camp and a light bulb turned on, I found out that this is something I might enjoy doing and the marathon begin.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Marathon">As the marathon continued I ventured into Google Cloud Technology where I obtained a "Google Cloud Platform Business Professional Accreditation" and would later obtain a "Google Analytics Individual Qualification". In April 2021 I started Digital Crafts Full Stack Web Development Flex Program where we are currently studying JavaScript and HTML/CSS and will cover by the end of the course front end and back end development.</p>
